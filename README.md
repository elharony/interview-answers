# Interview Anwers for a Full Stack Developer Position
Here is my answers for a Full Stack Developer Position Questions, it was 4 questions in *One* hour, and I tried to answer as much as possible of them. I almost answered 3 of them, the 3rd one isn't completed but the time was really tight.

## What I learned from this experience?
- Thinking takes time, sometimes even more than completing the task!
- Never get distracted with 2 questions. Use your time on ONE question is better than dividing it
- How to read about something for the first time, and answer its question
> _I consider reading the `User Stories` for the first time and come up with the required 5 User Stories in a minimal time is a great achievement!_

### Final Thought
To think of building and analyzing a website like `Netflix` is really challenging. _However, when you never use it - like me! - It is even harder to come up with details!_
